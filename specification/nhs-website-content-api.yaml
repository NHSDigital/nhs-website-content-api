    ## Overview
    This API provides content from the [NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk) as JSON, to be consumed programmatically and used by your application.

    You can reuse the content from the following sections of the NHS website:
      * Health A to Z / Conditions ([Website](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/) | [API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/nhs-website-content/v2#get-/conditions))
      * Medicines A to Z ([Website](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/) | [API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/nhs-website-content/v2#get-/medicines))
      * Mental health ([Website](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/) | [API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/nhs-website-content/v2#get-/mental-health))
      * Live Well ([Website](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/) | [API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/nhs-website-content/v2#get-/live-well))
      * Pregnancy ([Website](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/) | [API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/nhs-website-content/v2#get-/pregnancy))
      * NHS services ([Website](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/) | [API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/nhs-website-content/v2#get-/nhs-services))
      * Common health questions ([Website](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/) | [API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/nhs-website-content/v2#get-/common-health-questions))

      * Vaccinations ([Website](https://www.nhs.uk/vaccinations/) | [API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/nhs-website-content/v2#get-/vaccinations)).

    You cannot use this API to:
      * [find services near you](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/services-near-you/)
      * get Ratings and Reviews of NHS services.

    If you are migrating from our [old NHS website APIs](https://developer.api.nhs.uk/nhs-api), we have a [migration guide](https://developer.api.nhs.uk/support/migration/guide) to help walk you through the process and a [migration assistant](https://developer.api.nhs.uk/support/migration/assistant) to illustrate the differences in how your API requests will need to be updated.

    ## Who can use this API
    Anyone can use this API for any purpose, so long as they have agreed to the [Online connection agreement](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/online-connection-agreement) during the [onboarding process](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/onboarding-process) and they include an [attribution](#overview--attribution) as outlined below.

    ## Attribution
    Any syndicated content must incorporate the following attribution (credit) to the NHS website:

    <img src="https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/gallery/website/developer/api-catalogue/nhs-website-content/nhs-attribution.png" alt="Content supplied by the NHS website" width="801" height="157" style="width: 250px; height: 49px;" />

    The logo should be clearly visible and in line with the associated content on every web page that contains the syndicated content. You should also link this logo to the relevant page on the NHS website that the content has been supplied from.

    ```
    <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/THE_PATH_TO_THE_ORIGINAL_CONTENT_GOES_HERE" target="_blank">
      <img src="https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/gallery/website/developer/api-catalogue/nhs-website-content/nhs-attribution.png" alt="Content supplied by the NHS website" width="801" height="157" style="width: 250px; height: 49px;" />
    </a>
    ```

    The logo image URL is supplied as part of the JSON response under author:

    ```
    "author": {
      "url": "https://www.nhs.uk",
      "logo": "https://digital.nhs.uk/binaries/content/gallery/website/developer/api-catalogue/nhs-website-content/nhs-attribution.png",
      "email": "nhswebsite.servicedesk@nhs.net",
      "@type": "Organization",
      "name": "NHS website"
    }
    ```

    If you are displaying NHS syndicated content in a context where a functional link back to the article on the NHS website is not possible then you should use the following attribution (credit):

    ```
    <p>From <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/" target="_blank">www.nhs.uk<a/></p>
    ```

    ## Modularised content
    The standard content available through our syndication service is based on the full pages on the NHS website. With our modularised content, you can instead choose to use shorter, more specific sections of content (called "modules") from our pages. This means you can show your users only the content that's most relevant to them. You can also use this content more easily in services like apps and voice assistants.

    ### Benefits of our modularised content

    1. **More relevant content for users** &mdash; Users do not always want or need full pages of content. With our modularised content, you can choose exactly what your users get.

    2. **Suitable for a range of services** &mdash; Short, specific content modules can be used more easily than full web pages in services like apps, chatbots and voice assistants.

    3. **Clinical assurance** &mdash; Each module is checked by NHS clinicians before being made available and carries the trusted NHS brand.

    ### Available labels / health aspects

    We create modules by adding labels (health aspects) to sections of content on our web pages. For example, on our medical condition pages we have labels (health aspects) for sections on "Overview", "Symptoms", "Treatments", "Causes" and more. These labels (health aspects) are based on international standards for structured data from [Schema.org](https://schema.org/HealthAspectEnumeration). Before being made available, each module is checked by our clinical team to make sure it remains accurate and safe to use in isolation.

    ### Getting modularised content

    To get modularised content, you can use the boolean `modules` query parameter in the [conditions/*](#get-/conditions/*) and [medicines/*](#get-/medicines/*) endpoints. This will return the modularised version of the page (if there is one). If the requested page has not been modularised, the full page will be returned.

    You can get a list of which pages have (and have not) been modularised and which health aspects they contain by calling the `/manifest/pages/` endpoint.

    ## Schema page types

    Throughout the NHS website we have a couple of page models which are defined using the `@type` property. It is a good thing to implement each page type into your product, as multiple page types can be used within in a single genre (conditions, live-well, medicines, etc).

    1. **WebPage** &mdash; This is the default type and is [defined by Schema.org](https://schema.org/WebPage)

    2. **MedicalWebPage** &mdash; A web page that provides medical information and is [defined by Schema.org](https://schema.org/MedicalWebPage)

    Here is a list of properties for each schema page type we are currently using:

    | WebPage          | MedicalWebPage      |
    | ---------------- | ------------------- |
    | @context         | @context            |
    | @type            | @type               |
    | name             | name                |
    | copyrightHolder  | copyrightHolder     |
    | license          | license             |
    | author           | author              |
    | about            | about               |
    | description      | description         |
    | url              | url                 |
    | genre            | genre               |
    | keywords         | keywords            |
    | dateModified     | dateModified        |
    | lastReviewed     | lastReviewed        |
    | breadcrumb       | breadcrumb          |
    | hasPart          | hasPart             |
    | relatedLink      | relatedLink         |
    | contentSubTypes  | contentSubTypes     |
    | mainEntityOfPage | mainEntityOfPage    |
    |                  | alternativeHeadline |

    It is worth noting that the `genre` property is what we use to define which section the article sits in, and the `@type` is used to define how that article is structured.

    ## API status
    This API has moved from the [NHS website developer portal](https://developer.api.nhs.uk/). 
    It is currently [in production](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses).

    ## Service level
    This API is a [bronze service](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).

    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest).

    Page objects conform to global [schema.org](https://schema.org/) standards.

    ## Network access
    This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).

    To use this API with [NHS smartcards](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers), the end user needs an HSCN connection, although internet-facing alternatives to smartcards are available.

    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).

    ## Security and authorisation

    This API use the [Application-restricted RESTful API - API key authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-api-key-authentication) security pattern, meaning we authenticate the calling application but not the end user.

    When calling the Integration Test environment or Production environment, you must provide a valid `apikey` in your request header.

    To obtain an API key for each of these environments you must sign in to the [NHS Digital Onboarding Service - Developer account](https://onboarding.prod.api.platform.nhs.uk/Index) and register your application to be granted [environment access](https://onboarding.prod.api.platform.nhs.uk/MyApplications).

    Your API keys will look something like: `XW7DGBVQzO0yPKdPbRXeqITzbdJ1jNh7` (example apikey)

    <strong>NOTE:</strong> You will not need the 'Secret', and you don't need to specify a 'Public key URL' or a 'Callback URL' to use this API.

    ## Errors
    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:
      * 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action
      * 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application
      * 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server.

    Errors specific to each endpoint are shown in the endpoints section, under response. See our [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes) for more on errors.

    ## Environments and testing
    | Environment       | Base URL                                                               |

    ### Sandbox environment
    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):
    * is for early developer testing
    * only covers a limited set of scenarios
    * is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation (you do not need to provide an `apikey` in the request header)
    * is [rate limited](#overview--usage-caps)

    For details of sandbox test scenarios, or to try out the sandbox using our 'Try this API' feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.

    Alternatively, you can try out the sandbox using our Postman collection:

    [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/222854-abafff02-a96d-4259-9c0d-2f4d3fd6d4bf)

    ### Integration test environment
    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):
    * is for formal integration testing
    * includes authorisation via an API Key, which can be obtained from the [NHS Digital Onboarding Service - Developer account](https://onboarding.prod.api.platform.nhs.uk/Index)
    * has a restricted [rate limit](#overview--usage-caps)

    Here is an example cURL request, calling the integration test environment
    ```
    curl -X GET 'https://int.api.service.nhs.uk/nhs-website-content/conditions/' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -H 'apikey: YOUR_INTEGRATION_TEST_ENVIRONMENT_APIKEY_GOES_HERE'
    ```
         
    For more details see [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).

    ### Production environment
    Our production environment:
    * requires you to get your [application/product onboarded](#overview--onboarding) and approved by us
    * is to be used by your production application
    * includes authorisation via an API Key, which can be obtained from the [NHS Digital Onboarding Service - Developer account](https://onboarding.prod.api.platform.nhs.uk/Index). This will be different from your Integration test API key.
    * has a higher [rate limit](#overview--usage-caps)

    Here is an example cURL request, calling the production environment
    ```
    curl -X GET 'https://api.service.nhs.uk/nhs-website-content/conditions/' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -H 'apikey: YOUR_PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENT_APIKEY_GOES_HERE'
    ```

    ## Onboarding
    You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding.

    During this process you will be asked agree to the [Online connection agreement](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/online-connection-agreement).

    You can [submit your application/product for onboarding](https://onboarding.prod.api.platform.nhs.uk/Products) using the [Digital Onboarding Service](https://onboarding.prod.api.platform.nhs.uk/Index)

    ## Caching
    Caching of all responses from the NHS website content API is recommended, and you should do so where possible, unless otherwise notified to you by NHS Digital. The cached data should be refreshed no less than once every 7 days. If instructed to refresh cached NHS website content, you must do so immediately.

    ## Usage caps
    Calls to this API are rate limited as follows:
    | Environment       | Rate limit                      |
    | ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
    | Sandbox           | 60 requests per minute          |
    | Integration test  | 120 requests per minute         |
    | Production        | 1200 requests per minute        |

        ## Overview
        There is an endpoint for each page under the Health A to Z, for example https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chickenpox.

        This can be used to get specific information about individual topics.

        There is only one query parameter for these pages:

        | Query parameter   | Description                                                            | Type        |

        | modules           | If topic is modularised, only return these modules                     | boolean     |

        # Modularisation
        We modularise some of our content, meaning that individual parts of the page can be reused. If a page is modularised, content appears in the `hasPart` field.

        ## Ordering by dates

        The `orderBy` parameter can be `dateModified`, `lastReviewed` and `nextReview`. By default if any of the `orderBy` parameters are chosen the results are sorted by newest first.

        However, the `orderBy` parameter can be used with the `startDate` and `endDate` parameters to filter down to the desired date. `startDate` and `endDate` should be given in the YYYY-MM-DD format.

        For example `https://api.nhs.uk/medicines?startDate=2022-01-01&orderBy=dateModified`
