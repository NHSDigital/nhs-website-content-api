After the first dose, if you do not feel dizzy, you can take your medicine in the morning.</p><p>If you're taking atenolol twice a day, try to have 1 dose in the morning and 1 dose in the evening. It's a good idea to leave 10 to 12 hours between doses if you can.</p><p>Atenolol does not usually upset your stomach, so you can take it with or without food but it's best to do the same each day.</p><p>Swallow the tablets whole with a drink of water. If you find them difficult to swallow, some brands have a score line to help you break the tablet in half. Check the information leaflet for your brand to see if you can do this.</p><p>If you're taking atenolol as a liquid, it will come with a plastic syringe or spoon to help you measure out the right dose. If you do not have one, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not measure the right amount of medicine.</p><h2>How long to take it for</h2><p>This depends on why you're taking atenolol.</p><p>For heart conditions or high blood pressure, treatment is usually long term and may be for the rest of your life.</p><p>For migraines, treatment can last for several months or years, depending on how bad your symptoms are.</p><p>Talk to your doctor if you want to stop taking atenolol. Do not stop taking it suddenly, especially if you have heart disease. This can make your condition worse.</p><p>If you're bothered by side effects, your doctor may be able to prescribe a different medicine instead.</p><h2>If you forget to take it</h2><p>If you forget to take a dose of atenolol, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose. In this case, just skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.</p><p>Never take 2 doses at the same time. Do not take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.</p><p>If you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine.</p><h2><b>If you take too much</b></h2><p>The amount of atenolol that can lead to an overdose varies from person to person.</p><p>If you take more than the prescribed dose, your heart rate may slow down and you may find it difficult to breathe. It can also make you feel dizzy.</p>"
