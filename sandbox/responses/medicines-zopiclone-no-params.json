Do not crush or chew it.</p><p>You can take zopiclone with or without food.</p><h2>How long to take it for</h2><p>You'll usually be prescribed zopiclone for just 2 to 4 weeks.</p><p>This is because your body gets used to this medicine quickly, and after this time it's unlikely to have the same effect. Your body can also become dependent on it.</p><p>Do not stop taking zopiclone suddenly without speaking to your doctor. They may suggest you reduce your dose slowly to prevent withdrawal symptoms. However you're unlikely to have withdrawal symptoms if you've been taking it for less than a month.</p><p>If you still have sleeping problems after finishing your course of zopiclone, try lifestyle changes to <a>help you get to sleep</a>. See your doctor again if these do not help.</p><h2>If you forget to take it</h2><p>If you forget to take it by bedtime, just skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time the next night.</p><p>Never take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.</p><h2>If you take too much</h2><p>Taking more than your prescribed dose of zopiclone can be dangerous. You may get symptoms including:</p><ul><li>feeling drowsy, feeling confused, sleeping deeply and possibly going into a coma</li><li>feeling dizzy, light-headed or faint due to low blood pressure</li><li>floppy muscles</li><li>falling over or losing your balance</li><li>shallow breathing or difficulty breathing</li></ul>"
