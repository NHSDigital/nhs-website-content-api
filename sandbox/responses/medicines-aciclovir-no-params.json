          "text": "<p>Doses will vary, depending on why you're taking aciclovir. Your doctor will tell you how much to take and how often.</p><p>A single dose is generally between 200mg and 800mg. Doses may be lower for children.</p><p>You'll usually take aciclovir 2 to 5 times a day. Try to space your doses evenly throughout the day.</p><p>If you take aciclovir:</p><ul><li>4 times a day \u2013 you could take it first thing in the morning, at midday, in the late afternoon and at bedtime</li><li>5 times a day \u2013 you could take it at 7am, 11am, 3pm, 7pm and 11pm, for example</li></ul><p>Keep taking the medicine until it's all finished or until your doctor or pharmacist tells you to stop taking it.</p><p>For treating a viral infection, you'll usually take aciclovir for 5 to 10 days. For prevention, you may need to take it for a long time.</p><h2>How to take tablets and liquid</h2><p>You can take aciclovir tablets or liquid with or without food. Drink plenty of water while taking this medicine to help keep your kidneys working well.</p><p>Swallow the tablets whole with a drink of water.</p><p>If you find tablets difficult to swallow, you can dissolve them in water. Add a tablet to a small glass of water and stir. Drink all the liquid to make sure you get the full dose.</p><p>Aciclovir liquid will come with a measuring spoon or plastic syringe to help you measure your dose. If you do not have a measuring spoon or syringe, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not measure the right amount of medicine.</p><h2>How to use cream for cold sores</h2><p>Wash your hands before and after using the cream.</p><p>Put a thin layer of cream on the cold sore 5 times a day. Do this every 4 hours \u2013 for example, at 7am, 11am, 3pm, 7pm and 11pm.</p><p>Do not put aciclovir cream inside your mouth, in your eyes or vagina.</p><p>Use the cream for at least 4 days. If the cold sore has not healed by then, you can carry on using the cream for another 6 days.</p><p>If the cold sore still has not healed after a total of 10 days, stop using the cream and tell your doctor.</p><h2>How to use cream for genital herpes</h2><p>Wash your hands before and after using the cream.</p><p>Put a thin layer of cream on the affected area 5 times a day. Do this every 4 hours \u2013 for example, at 7am, 11am, 3pm, 7pm and 11pm.</p><p>Use the cream for at least 5 days. If the genital herpes sore has not healed by then, you can carry on using the cream for another 5 days.</p><p>If the affected area has still not healed after a total of 10 days, stop using the cream and tell your doctor.</p><h2>How to use eye ointment</h2><p>Put the ointment in the affected eye 5 times a day, or as your doctor advises.</p><ol><li>Wash your hands.</li><li>Gently pull down your lower eyelid and tilt your head back.</li><li>Hold the tube with the nozzle close to your eye and gently squeeze about 1 centimetre of ointment into the space between your lower lid and your eye.</li><li>Close your eye for a few minutes.</li></ol><p>Try not to let the tip of the eye ointment tube touch any part of your eye. This is to keep it free from germs.</p><p>Space the times when you use the eye ointment evenly throughout the day \u2013 for example at 7am, 11am, 3pm, 7pm and 11pm.</p><p>Keep using the eye ointment for at least 3 days after your eye has got better.</p><p>If you wear contact lenses, do not use them while you're using the eye ointment. This is because some medicines or preservatives in eye ointments can build up in contact lenses and may damage them.</p><p>Your vision might become a little blurred after you use the eye ointment. Blink several times after putting the eye ointment in to help clear your vision. Do not drive, cycle or use any tools or machinery until you can see clearly again.</p><h2>If you forget to take or use it</h2><p>If you forget a dose of aciclovir, take it (or use the cream or eye ointment) as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose. In this case, just skip the missed dose and continue with your next one at the usual time.</p><p>Never have 2 doses at the same time. Never have an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.</p><p>If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicines.</p><h2>If you take or use too much</h2><p>Using too much aciclovir cream or eye ointment is unlikely to harm you.</p><p>Taking too many aciclovir tablets or too much liquid is also unlikely to harm you, unless you do so over several days.</p><p>Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you're worried that you have had too much aciclovir.</p>"
